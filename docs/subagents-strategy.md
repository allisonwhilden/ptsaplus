# PTSA+ Specialized Subagents Strategy

## Overview

This document defines the specialized subagents we should create for the PTSA+ project, leveraging Claude Code's new subagent capabilities to enhance development efficiency and maintain high standards across critical areas like privacy compliance, UI consistency, and volunteer-friendly design.

## Core Principles for Subagent Selection

1. **Risk Mitigation**: Focus on areas with highest project risk (payments, privacy, AI costs)
2. **Expertise Amplification**: Create agents for specialized knowledge domains
3. **Consistency Enforcement**: Ensure adherence to project standards
4. **Efficiency Gains**: Automate repetitive or complex analysis tasks

## Recommended Subagents

### 1. 🎨 UI/UX Consistency Agent (`ui-consistency`)

**Purpose**: Ensure all UI implementations follow our shadcn/ui-first approach and maintain consistency with our volunteer-centric design principles.

**When to Use**:

4. AI Cost Optimizer
5. Volunteer Experience Agent
6. Performance Monitor

### Phase 3: Quality Agents (Week 3)
7. Architecture Guardian
8. Test Coverage Agent

## MCP Server Integration

### shadcn/ui MCP Server Setup

The UI/UX Consistency Agent should be configured with the shadcn-ui-mcp-server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "shadcn-ui": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@jpisnice/shadcn-ui-mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Always up-to-date component information
- Direct access to component source code
- Usage examples and patterns
- Installation instructions

**Considerations**:

- May need GitHub token for rate limits
- Should cache responses for efficiency

## Concerns and Mitigations

### 1. **Over-Specialization**
**Concern**: Too many agents could create confusion about which to use.
**Mitigation**: Start with critical agents, add others based on need. Create clear "when to use" guidelines.

### 2. **Conflicting Recommendations**
**Concern**: Different agents might give conflicting advice.
**Mitigation**: Establish hierarchy (e.g., Privacy > Performance) and document trade-off decisions.

### 3. **Maintenance Overhead**
**Concern**: Keeping agent prompts updated as project evolves.
**Mitigation**: Review agent configurations during sprint retrospectives, update as needed.

### 4. **MCP Server Reliability**
**Concern**: External dependency on shadcn-ui MCP server.
**Mitigation**: Implement caching, have fallback to manual component lookup.

### 5. **Agent Sprawl**
**Concern**: Team members creating too many specialized agents.
**Mitigation**: Require review before creating new agents, consolidate similar agents.

## Success Metrics

- **Privacy Compliance**: Zero FERPA/COPPA violations
- **UI Consistency**: 95%+ adherence to shadcn/ui components
- **Payment Security**: Pass PCI compliance audit
- **AI Costs**: Stay under $0.10/user/month
- **Performance**: Meet 3-second load time on 3G
- **Test Coverage**: Maintain 80%+ coverage on critical paths

## Recommendations

1. **Start Small**: Implement the three most critical agents first (Privacy, UI, Payment)
2. **Measure Impact**: Track how often each agent is used and the value it provides
3. **Iterate Based on Usage**: Refine prompts based on actual usage patterns
4. **Share Team-Wide**: Make all agents available to the team, not personal
5. **Document Decisions**: When agents flag issues, document the resolution

## Future Considerations

As the project grows, consider agents for:
- Database optimization
- Internationalization compliance
- Accessibility testing
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Documentation quality
- API design consistency

## Conclusion

These specialized subagents will help maintain high standards across critical areas while allowing developers to move quickly with confidence. The key is starting with the highest-risk areas and expanding based on actual need rather than speculation.
