# PTSA+ Security & Compliance Guidelines

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive security measures and compliance requirements for the PTSA+ platform. Our approach prioritizes the protection of sensitive data, particularly information about children and families, while ensuring compliance with educational, financial, and privacy regulations.

## Security Philosophy

### Core Principles
1. **Privacy by Design**: Security and privacy considerations in every feature
2. **Least Privilege**: Users only access what they need
3. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
4. **Transparency**: Clear communication about data handling
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Regular audits and updates
