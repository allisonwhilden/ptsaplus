# PTSA Platform MVP Features

## Overview
This document outlines the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) features for the PTSA platform (originally PTSA+). The project has pivoted to focus on a single PTSA implementation first. These features represent the core functionality needed to provide immediate value to our PTSA while establishing a foundation that could potentially scale to multiple PTSAs in the future.
