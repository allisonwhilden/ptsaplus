## Best Practices

### For Event Organizers
1. Use descriptive titles that clearly indicate the event purpose
2. Provide detailed descriptions including what to bring/expect
3. Set realistic capacity limits
4. Create volunteer slots with clear role descriptions
5. Choose appropriate visibility settings

### For Platform Administrators
1. Regularly review upcoming events for accuracy
2. Monitor RSVP rates to gauge engagement
3. Archive past events to maintain performance
4. Use event analytics to plan future activities

## Future Enhancements (Phase 2)

- **Recurring Events**: Weekly/monthly event templates
- **Event Templates**: Save common event configurations
- **Automated Reminders**: Email reminders 48 hours before events
- **QR Code Check-in**: Generate QR codes for event check-in
- **Advanced Analytics**: Attendance trends, popular event types
- **Integration**: Sync with Google Calendar, iCal feeds
- **Ticketing**: Paid event support with Stripe integration

## Performance Considerations

- Events are paginated (20 per page) for optimal loading
- Calendar view fetches only current month's events
- RSVP counts are calculated efficiently using database aggregation
- Proper indexes on frequently queried fields (start_time, visibility)

## Accessibility

- All form inputs have proper labels
- Calendar is keyboard navigable
- Color alone is not used to convey information
- ARIA labels for interactive elements
- Focus management for modals and dialogs
