# PTSA Month 1 Development Plan: Risk-Based Approach

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a risk-based development approach for the first month of PTSA platform development. The project has been simplified to focus on a single PTSA's needs rather than a multi-tenant platform. We'll focus on validating the highest-risk assumptions through targeted prototypes and proof-of-concept implementations.

**Key Strategy**: Build a functional platform for a single PTSA that proves we can handle payments, protect student data, control AI costs, and deliver a simple experience for non-technical volunteers.

**Update (Jan 7)**: Pivoted from multi-tenant PTSA+ to single PTSA focus. Completed user registration, member management, and role assignment features.

**Update (Jan 8)**: Successfully deployed to Vercel with GitHub CI/CD pipeline. Fixed Next.js 15 compatibility issues. Environment configured with Clerk and Supabase.

## Risk Analysis & Prioritization

### Critical Risks (Must Solve in Month 1)

#### 1. Payment Processing & Compliance
**Risk Level**: ðŸ”´ Critical  
**Impact**: Without payments, there's no business  
**Validation Needed**: 
- Can we process payments securely?
- Will Stripe Connect work for PTSA needs?
- Can we handle guest checkout smoothly?

#### 2. User Experience for Non-Technical Volunteers
**Risk Level**: ðŸ”´ Critical  
**Impact**: If volunteers can't use it, PTSAs won't adopt  
**Validation Needed**:
- Can a stressed parent complete registration in 2 minutes?
- Can a new treasurer understand the financial dashboard?
- Does the "5-minute test" pass for core features?

#### 3. FERPA/COPPA Compliance
**Risk Level**: ðŸ”´ Critical  
**Impact**: Legal liability, loss of trust  
**Validation Needed**:
- Can we properly segregate and protect student data?
- Do our consent flows meet legal requirements?
- Can parents control their family's privacy?

#### 4. AI Cost Control
**Risk Level**: ðŸŸ¡ High  
**Impact**: Could make platform economically unviable  
**Validation Needed**:
- Can we effectively cache AI responses?
- Can we prevent runaway API costs?
- Is the AI actually helpful for volunteers?

### Secondary Risks (Address in Month 2+)

- Email deliverability at scale
- Complex SSO integrations
- Microservices coordination
- School system integrations
- Multi-language support complexity

## Development Approach

### Core Principle: Validate Before Building

Instead of building the complete microservices architecture, we'll create a modular monolith that can be split later. This allows us to:
- Move faster with less complexity
- Validate core assumptions quickly
- Pivot based on real user feedback
- Defer infrastructure decisions

### Technology Choices for Month 1

```yaml
Frontend:
  Framework: Next.js 14 with TypeScript (App Router)
  UI Components: shadcn/ui (PRIMARY - use first, document if alternatives needed)
  Styling: Tailwind CSS v3.4.x (IMPORTANT: NOT v4 - compatibility issues)
  CSS Animation: tailwindcss-animate v1.0.x
  Icons: Lucide React (comes with shadcn/ui)
  Forms: React Hook Form + Zod validation
  State: Zustand + React Query
  Deployment: Vercel
  
Component Strategy:
  - Start with shadcn/ui for all UI needs
  - If gap found, document and get approval for alternatives
  - Maintain Tailwind CSS v3 compatibility
  - Keep accessibility standards high
  
Version Notes:
  - Tailwind v4 is still in beta and has breaking changes
  - Many community components aren't v4 compatible yet
  - Stick with v3.4.x for stability
  
Backend:
  Framework: Next.js API Routes (start simple)
  Database: PostgreSQL (Supabase)
  Auth: Clerk (managed service)
  Payments: Stripe Connect
  
AI:
  Provider: OpenAI API
  Caching: Redis (Upstash)
  
Monitoring:
  Analytics: Posthog
  Errors: Sentry
  Costs: Custom dashboard
```

## Technical Decisions & Rationale

### Why Start with a Monolith?
1. **Faster Development**: Single codebase, single deployment
2. **Easier Testing**: No service coordination complexity
3. **Lower Costs**: One database, one hosting bill
4. **Simpler Debugging**: All code in one place
5. **Future-Proof**: Can extract services later

### Why Use Managed Services?
1. **Clerk for Auth**: Complex auth is a solved problem
2. **Supabase for Database**: Includes auth, real-time, storage
3. **Vercel for Hosting**: Zero-config deployment
4. **Upstash for Redis**: Serverless, pay-per-use

### Why These Specific Features?
1. **Payment First**: Validates business model
2. **Privacy Second**: Validates compliance approach  
3. **AI Third**: Validates cost model
4. **Simple UI**: Validates volunteer usability

## Team Roles & Responsibilities

### Week 1-2: Core Development
- **Lead Developer**: Full-stack implementation
- **UI/UX Designer**: Design system and user flows (part-time)
- **Product Manager**: User stories and testing

### Week 3-4: Specialized Work
- **AI Developer**: AI integration and cost control
- **Security Engineer**: Compliance and audit (part-time)
- **QA Engineer**: Testing and user feedback

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### Payment Risks
- Use Stripe's tested integration
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Add manual fallback options
- Monitor all transactions

### Privacy Risks
- Privacy by default design
- Minimal data collection
- Clear consent flows
- Regular compliance audits

### AI Risks
- Hard spending limits
- Aggressive caching
- Manual approval for high usage
- Daily cost monitoring

### User Experience Risks
- Test with real volunteers early
- Iterate based on feedback
- Keep features minimal
- Provide extensive help

## Dependencies & Prerequisites

### Before Starting
1. **Accounts Created**:
   - GitHub organization
   - Stripe Connect account
   - Supabase project
   - Vercel team
   - OpenAI API access
   - Clerk application

2. **Legal Preparation**:
   - Privacy policy draft
   - Terms of service draft
   - COPPA compliance checklist
   - FERPA guidelines review

3. **Team Access**:
   - All team members have accounts
   - Development environment setup
   - Communication channels established

## Month 2 Planning Based on Outcomes

### If Payment Validation Succeeds
- Add more payment methods
- Build subscription management
- Create financial reporting

### If Privacy Features Work Well
- Expand to full member directory
- Add document sharing
- Build communication features

### If AI Costs Are Controlled
- Add more AI features
- Build predictive analytics
- Create automated workflows

### If Users Love the Experience
- Recruit more testers
- Begin marketing site
- Start sales conversations

## Conclusion

This risk-based approach for Month 1 focuses on validating the most critical assumptions before committing to the full architecture. By building targeted prototypes, we can:

1. **Prove the business model** through working payments
2. **Validate compliance approach** with real privacy features
3. **Control AI costs** with actual usage data
4. **Confirm usability** with volunteer feedback

The modular monolith approach allows us to move fast while keeping options open for the future microservices architecture. Most importantly, we'll have working software that real PTSAs can start using by the end of Month 1.
