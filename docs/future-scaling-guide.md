# Future Scaling Guide: From Single PTSA to Multi-Tenant Platform

## Overview

This document outlines how to transform the current single-PTSA platform into a multi-tenant SaaS platform serving multiple PTSAs. This is a future consideration after proving success with our own PTSA.

## Current Architecture (Single PTSA)

### Database Structure
- Single set of tables for one PTSA
- No organization separation needed
- Direct user-to-role relationships
- Simplified permissions model

### Application Structure
- Hardcoded PTSA information
- Single domain setup
- No tenant isolation
- Simplified routing

### Benefits of Current Approach
- Faster development
- Lower complexity
- Easier maintenance
- Lower hosting costs
- Focused feature development

## Multi-Tenant Architecture (Future)

### Database Changes Required

#### 1. Add Organizations Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE organizations (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(255),
  slug VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE,
  domain VARCHAR(255),
  settings JSONB,
  subscription_status VARCHAR(50),
  created_at TIMESTAMP
);
```

#### 2. Add Organization Context
- Add `organization_id` to most tables
- Update all queries to filter by organization
- Implement row-level security per organization
- Add organization membership table

#### 3. Update Relationships
```sql
-- Example: Events table modification
ALTER TABLE events 
ADD COLUMN organization_id UUID REFERENCES organizations(id);

-- Add composite indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_events_org_id ON events(organization_id, start_date);
```

### Application Changes Required

#### 1. Tenant Resolution
```typescript
// Middleware to identify tenant
- By subdomain: schoolname.ourplatform.com
- By custom domain: www.schoolptsa.org
- By slug: ourplatform.com/org/schoolname
```

#### 2. Context Isolation
```typescript
// Add organization context to all requests
interface RequestContext {
  user: User
  organization: Organization
  permissions: Permission[]
}
```

#### 3. Data Isolation
- Filter all queries by organization_id
- Prevent cross-tenant data access
- Separate file storage by tenant
- Isolate background jobs

### Infrastructure Changes

#### 1. Domain Management
- Wildcard SSL certificate
- Custom domain support
- DNS configuration per tenant
- Domain verification process

#### 2. Scaling Considerations
- Database connection pooling per tenant
- Caching strategy per organization
- Background job queues per tenant
- Storage partitioning

#### 3. Deployment Strategy
- Blue-green deployments
- Gradual rollout capabilities
- Tenant-specific feature flags
- A/B testing framework

## Migration Path

### Phase 1: Prepare Foundation (No Breaking Changes)
1. Add nullable organization_id columns
2. Create organizations table
3. Add tenant resolution logic (inactive)
4. Build organization management UI
5. Test with single organization

### Phase 2: Soft Launch (Invite Only)
1. Enable multi-tenant mode for select users
2. Migrate existing data to organization
3. Test tenant isolation thoroughly
4. Gather feedback from pilot organizations

### Phase 3: General Availability
1. Open registration for new PTSAs
2. Implement billing/subscriptions
3. Add onboarding flow
4. Enable self-service features

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
1. White-label options
2. API access for integrations
3. Multi-organization users
4. District-wide deployments

## Technical Considerations

### Security
- Tenant data isolation
- Cross-tenant access prevention
- Audit logging per tenant
- Compliance certifications

### Performance
- Query optimization with tenant filtering
- Caching strategies
- Connection pooling
- CDN configuration

### Monitoring
- Per-tenant metrics
- Usage tracking
- Error rates by organization
- Performance monitoring

### Backup & Recovery
- Tenant-specific backups
- Point-in-time recovery
- Data export capabilities
- Disaster recovery plan

## Business Model Considerations

- [ ] Implement RLS policies
- [ ] Add migration scripts
- [ ] Test data isolation
- [ ] Performance testing

### Application Layer
- [ ] Tenant resolution middleware
- [ ] Update all queries
- [ ] Add organization context
- [ ] Update UI components
- [ ] Test cross-tenant security

### Infrastructure Layer
- [ ] Set up wildcard domains
- [ ] Configure load balancing
- [ ] Implement caching
- [ ] Set up monitoring
- [ ] Plan scaling strategy

### Business Layer
- [ ] Define pricing model
- [ ] Build billing system
- [ ] Create onboarding flow
- [ ] Develop support system
- [ ] Plan go-to-market strategy

## Cost Projections

### Single PTSA (Current)
- Hosting: ~$50/month
- Domain: $15/year
- Services: ~$30/month
- Total: ~$80/month

### Multi-Tenant Platform
- Infrastructure: $500-2000/month
- Services: $200-500/month
- Support staff: $2000+/month
- Marketing: $1000+/month
- Total: $4000+/month

Break-even: ~50-60 paying PTSAs

## Risks & Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- Data breach: Implement strong isolation
- Performance degradation: Plan capacity carefully
- Complexity increase: Maintain good documentation

### Business Risks
- Slow adoption: Start with freemium model
- Competition: Focus on unique features
- Support burden: Build self-service tools

### Operational Risks
- Scaling issues: Use cloud services
- Update conflicts: Implement feature flags
- Customer churn: Focus on success metrics

## Conclusion

Scaling from a single PTSA platform to a multi-tenant SaaS is a significant undertaking but follows established patterns. The key is to:

1. Prove value with single PTSA first
2. Build with future scaling in mind
3. Migrate gradually with minimal disruption
4. Focus on customer success metrics

The current single-PTSA approach is the right starting point, allowing us to validate features and workflows before adding multi-tenant complexity.
