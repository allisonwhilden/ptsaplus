# Documentation Updates Summary - January 2025

This document summarizes the updates made to the PTSA platform documentation to reflect the current implementation status.

## Project Status Update

- **Week Days**: Marked completed days (Jan 7-8) with checkmarks
- **Deliverables**: Updated Week 1 deliverables to show what's been completed

### 5. Technical Architecture
- **Title**: Updated to reflect platform name change
- **Current Implementation**: Added new section showing simplified architecture in production
- **Architecture Diagram**: Created ASCII diagram of current stack
- **Note**: Added clarification that document shows long-term vision vs current state

## Key Implementation Highlights

### Completed Features âœ…
1. User authentication with Clerk
2. Member registration and management
3. Role-based access control (5 role types)
4. Privacy-compliant data handling
5. Member directory with search/filter
6. Production deployment on Vercel
7. CI/CD pipeline with GitHub

### In Progress ðŸ”„
1. Stripe payment integration
2. Event management system
3. Email communications
4. AI-assisted features

### Technology Confirmations
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15.4.4 (not 14 as originally planned)
- **UI**: shadcn/ui with Tailwind CSS v3.4.17 (not v4)
- **Database**: Supabase with Row Level Security
- **Auth**: Clerk with webhook integration
- **Hosting**: Vercel with edge deployment

## Architecture Approach

The project has successfully implemented a modular monolith approach using Next.js API Routes rather than jumping directly to microservices. This allows for:
- Faster development and deployment
- Lower operational complexity
- Easy future service extraction when needed
- Cost-effective scaling for a single PTSA

## Next Steps

Based on the current state, the immediate priorities are:
1. Complete Stripe payment integration for membership dues
2. Build event management system
3. Implement email communications
4. Add AI features with cost controls
5. Continue gathering user feedback from the deployed platform

The documentation now accurately reflects that the platform is operational with core features and actively being used, rather than being in the planning phase.
