# Our PTSA Platform Overview

## Executive Summary

This platform is a custom-built solution for our Parent-Teacher-Student Association, designed to replace the limitations of generic school website builders. By creating our own platform, we gain full control over member management, event planning, financial operations, and communications - all tailored specifically to our PTSA's needs.

## Current Focus

## Vision

To create a platform that perfectly fits our PTSA's operations, making it easier for volunteers to manage activities and for parents to stay engaged - with the potential to share this solution with other PTSAs in the future if successful.
